# My OSTEP Projects

My implementation of [OSTEP projects](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) (*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*). These projects are part of OSSU's Operating Systems [course roadmap](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/coursepages/ostep/README.md).

## Implementations

* [X] `initial-utilities`
  * [X] `wcat` (C and Rust)
  * [X] `wgrep` (C and Rust)
  * [X] `wzip` and `wunzip` (C and Rust)

* [ ] [processes shell](./projects-in-c/) - `wish`
  * [ ] C (in progress)
  * [ ] Rust

## Requirements

To compile C code:

* `c99` (C compiler)
* `make` (for Makefile)

To compile Rust code:

* `rustc`
* `cargo`
